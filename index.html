                        As a dedicated and versatile Computer Science student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I am poised to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in June 2025. My academic journey, complemented by a GPA of 3.56, has equipped me with a robust foundation in programming, algorithms, and machine learning. I have honed my technical skills through coursework in Programming Abstraction, Computer Systems, Data Analysis, and Computer Architecture, among others.

I bring hands-on experience in a wide array of programming languages and technologies including Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and various tools and frameworks such as Git, Django, and Node.js. My professional experience as a Tech Engineer at Ethiopian Christian Fellowship Church demonstrates my ability to leverage APIs and automate processes, enhancing operational efficiency.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have developed and deployed several innovative projects such as Modbot Wireless Control System, Huffman Compression, and ConcurConnect. My involvement in the Google Developer Student Club as a Backend Developer has further refined my skills, including engineering an advanced Android app hosted on Firebase and utilizing machine learning for class recommendations.

I am also actively contributing as a Firmware Engineer with Autoslug, where I am enhancing modular bots with distance-sensing capabilities using Raspberry Pi Pico. My skill set is complemented by strong soft skills, including effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.

My interests lie in databases, UX, AI, web development, and software engineering, where I continuously seek opportunities to apply and expand my knowledge. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions and am excited about future endeavors that align with my expertise and career aspirations.
